        <h3>Here are some quotes by the guy:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.</li>
          <li>Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.</li>
          <li>The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.</li>
          <li>If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.</li>
          <li>Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.</li>
          <li>Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.</li>
          <li>There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.</li>
          <li>Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.</li>
          <li>Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.</li>
          <li>Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.</li>
        </ul>  
        <h3>See, he was pretty smart!</h3>
        </br>
        <h3 class="text-centered">
          He has a long list of contributions to science, most notably:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li><h4>His theory of relativity and E=mc^2.</h4></li>
          <li><h4>Thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics.</h4></li>
          <li><h4>Photons and energy quanta.</h4></li>
          <li><h4>Quantized atomic vibrations.</h4></li>
          <li><h4>Adiabatic principle and action-angle variables.</h4></li>
          <li><h4>Waveâ€“particle duality.</h4></li>
          <li><h4>And many, many more...</h4></li>
        </ul>
        <p>His <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Wikipedia</a> page is quite long and I won't read it all but somebody should because from what I did read he sounds pretty amazing. 
        </br></br>
        For even more information on Einstein's acheivments, you can go to <a href="http://einstein.biz/">this</a> website which contains his entire biography. It makes for an interesting read.
